# Computational Proteomics Paper 

## Description 

This repository contains the manuscript in computational proteomics. Our aim here is to describe how the proteomics community is developing and using bioinformatics software. 

## Commenting and contributing 

We hope to write a manuscript by the computational proteomics community that discuss the challenges, oportunities and drawbacks in current Computational Pooteomics by 2019. Feel free to open an issue if there is any point you would like to raise or discuss.

- Anyone from the community is encorage to discuss topics for the manuscript, including structure, titles, topics, etc. This can be done by opening an issue in [issues](https://github.com/ypriverol/compomics-paper/issues). 

- If you want to change a document inclufing the manuscript, statistics, or figure; you can do it by creating a Pull request into the master branch. 

- Fell free to browse through existing/past issues and if one seems related, comment on it. If no existing issue seems appropriate, a new issue can be opened to discuss the suggestion. In particular, we would appreciate discussing more substantial changes (for example suggestion of new rules) in a dedicated issue before sending a pull request.
